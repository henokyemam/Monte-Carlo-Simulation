# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
This repo will contain theories related to Monte Carlo Simulation, practice code examples with python and potential projects that can be tackled using this technique. There will be an emphasis on the use of MCS to measure the impact of risk and uncertainties.This repo is a work in progress. 
Definition:
MCS is a method of estimating the value of an unknown quantity using the principles of inferencial statistics (a random sample tends to exhibit the same properties as the population from which it is drawn).
