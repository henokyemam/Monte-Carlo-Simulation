# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
This repo will contain theories related to Monte Carlo Simulation, practice code examples with python and potential projects that can be tackled using this technique. There will be an emphasis on the use of MCS to measure the impact of risk and uncertainties.This repo is a work in progress.
